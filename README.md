# ChadBod

ChadBod is a Java application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that aids you in keeping track of your tasks 
as well as their associated details and dates. You can ask the tool to add and delete tasks to/from a list, 
display all tasks in said list, mark tasks as done or not done, or even search tasks containing a keyword.
